 * bitmap, in order to show the scaled down version. To avoid this,
 * ::createTiledBitmap() creates pre-scaled versions of your bitmap,
 * that are reduced by a factor 8. Such a pre-scaled version is called
 * a Layer. If your bitmap gets very large, several pre-scaled
 * versions are created, reduced by a factor 8, 64, 512, 4096, etc.
 *
 * So, to summarize, ::createTiledBitmap() creates several layers of your
 * bitmap, at zoom levels 1:1, 1:8, 1:64, etc. Each layer is then
 * divided into tiles, such that only the relevant part can be loaded
 * into memory.
 *
 * Of course ::createTiledBitmap() doesn't know anything about how you
 * choose to represent your bitmap data, so you'll have to specify (by
 * implementing LayerOperations) how to draw portions of your bitmap
 * at given zoom levels, and how to pre-scale your bitmap.
 *
 * @note When calling ::createTiledBitmap(), all the internal data
 * structures will be set up. You still have to fill your bitmap with
 * data, for example by calling TiledBitmapInterface::setSource()
 *
 * @param bitmapWidth the width of the bitmap
 * @param bitmapHeight the height of the bitmap
 * @param ls LayerOperations objects, specifying how to draw (portions
 *    of) your bitmap at given zoom levels
 *
 * @return A pointer to a newly created TiledBitmapInterface. You can
 *    use this pointer to manipulate your bitmap.
