/**
 * Jump the queue of a ThreadPool
 *
 * Have you ever seen a couple going shopping in the mall, where the
 * husband will go and wait in the queue for the register, while the
 * wife goes out into the shop and brings items to her husband,
 * already waiting to pay them? With QueueJumper, you'll get to be the
 * wife, while QueueJumper is the husband.
 *
 * You'll create() a QueueJumper, and schedule() it on a
 * ThreadPool. While the QueueJumper sits in the queue, waiting to be
 * processed, you can do whatever you want. At some later time, you'll
 * call setWork(). If the QueueJumper is still in the queue, it will
 * accept the work, and it will eventually get executed. Of course, if
 * the QueueJumper is no longer in the queue, you're out of luck.
 *
 * QueueJumper is used to maximally use the number of cores you have
 * available in your system, however many (or few) that is. Let's
 * assume you have a single threaded task (say, reading data from a
 * bitmap) that spawns a lot of background tasks (i.e. pre-scaling the
 * bitmap to some pre-defined zoom levels) that can be executed in
 * parallel. On any given system, two things can happen
 * @li The scaling is faster than the loading.
 * @li The scaling is slower than the loading.
 *
 * Let's assume for the moment that reading data from a bitmap is a
 * task that reads a given number of lines (say 1024 or some such),
 * and then reschedules itself. Let's assume also that all of these
 * threads are scheduled at the same priority. You'll start out as
 * follows:
@verbatim
| Queue | R
@endverbatim
 * Shown here is a ThreadPool queue, with one job in it, marked @c R,
 * because it is a Reading job. After the reading job has completed,
 * the queue will look as follows:
@verbatim
| Queue | S S S S S S S S S S
@endverbatim
 * The queue now has some (say 10) scaling jobs in it, which can be
 * executed in parallel. Let's also reschedule our reading task:
@verbatim
| Queue | S S S S S S S S S S R
@endverbatim
 * Wait a minute! The scaling tasks can be executed in parallel, but
 * the reading task will be scheduled last, and then we'll be back to
 * waiting for it to complete, while my x-core machine is using only
 * one core. Let's fix that by executing our reading task at a higher
 * priority, such that it gets executed first.
@verbatim
| Higher prio | R
| Normal prio | S S S S S S S S S S
@endverbatim
 * In this scenario, our new reading task will be executed, while the
 * other cores are busy with the scaling jobs. When the scaling jobs
 * are finished, there are hopefully new scaling jobs waiting to be
 * processed.
 *
 * This will, in fact, work fine if the scaling is faster than the
 * reading. By the time the Reading task has scheduled new Scaling
 * jobs, all the previous ones will have finished. Problems may start,
 * however, if the Reading is faster than the Scaling. When the
 * Reading is finished (and has scheduled 10 new Scaling jobs), the
 * old scaling jobs still haven't completed. As a result, the number
 * of remaining scaling jobs will grow and grow. Worst case, on a
 * 1-core machine, no scaling job will get processed, because there is
 * always a reading job with a higher priority in the queue. That is,
 * of course, until all reading jobs have finished. Scaling will begin
 * only when the bitmap is completely loaded.
 *
 * For you, this may or may not be a problem. But if you are dealing
 * with very large bitmaps, then a scenario of first loading the
 * bitmap and then scaling it involves a lot of swapping: First you
 * load the bitmap, and as you load it, you'll swap out the older
 * unused parts. And then when you start scaling, you'll have to swap
 * those parts back in. It is much more efficient to do the scaling
 * before swapping out the old parts, and then swap out the old and
 * the scaled parts in one go. This is where QueueJumper can help out.
 *
 * Let's revisit for a moment the scenario where Reading jobs are
 * scheduled at a higher priority:
@verbatim
| Higher prio | R
| Normal prio | S S S S S S S S S S
@endverbatim
 * When the Reading job starts, the first thing it does is schedule a
 * QueueJumper:
@verbatim
| Higher prio |
| Normal prio | S S S S S S S S S S Q
@endverbatim
 * Next, it will proceed to read bitmap data, which will result in
 * additional scaling jobs:
@verbatim
| Higher prio |
| Normal prio | S S S S S S S S S S Q S S S S S S S S S S
@endverbatim
 * In the mean time, the other cores (if any) are busy with the
 * scaling jobs. Like we observed earlier, there are two possible
 * scenarios
 *
 * <b>Scaling is faster than reading</b><br>
 * When the reading job
 * completes, all earlier scaling jobs will have finished. Also, the
 * QueueJumper will have been processed (doing no work)
@verbatim
| Higher prio |
| Normal prio | S S S S S S S S S S
@endverbatim
 * In this case, QueueJumper::setWork() will fail, because the
 * QueueJumper is no longer in the queue. You will have to reschedule
 * your reading task at the higher priority, like we did before:
@verbatim
| Higher prio | R
| Normal prio | S S S S S S S S S S
@endverbatim
 * In this scenario, you are not optimally using all cores, because
 * reading is a bottleneck.
 *
 * <b>Reading is faster than scaling</b><br>
 * When the reading job
 * completes, there will still be scaling jobs left in the queue. Also
 * the QueueJumper will still be there:
@verbatim
| Higher prio |
| Normal prio | S S S S Q S S S S S S S S S S
@endverbatim
 * If we now schedule a Reading task at a higher priority, like before,
 * then the number of scaling tasks will grow and grow. But if we call
 * QueueJumper::setWork(), then we can effectively substitute the
 * QueueJumper with our reading task:
@verbatim
| Higher prio |
| Normal prio | S S S S R S S S S S S S S S S
@endverbatim
 * This way, the reading task will not be started immediately, but
 * still sufficiently early. We can be confident that the new reading
 * task, too, is finished before the scaling tasks that succeed it.
 *
 * Memory behaviour is very attractive to: We need to have only two
 * "batches" in memory: One that is currently being read and one that
 * is currently being scaled. After those tasks complete, we'll not
 * need the data again until it is time to show the bitmap on the
 * screen.
